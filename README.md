*Notes From a B Tech Brain* is more than a blog — it’s a living publication that grows with me.  
It’s a platform that blends soft skills, technology, and global awareness into one thoughtful weekly read.  

The idea began with three weekly newsletters:  
- **Friday Insights** – reflections on mindset, learning, and personal growth.  
- **Tech Pulse** – updates and explainers on tech, AI, and innovation.  
- **World Watch** – geopolitical and world news summaries from a student lens.  

Now, the goal is to turn these three streams into a **unified full-stack magazine**, where every edition lives online — dynamic, searchable, and personal.

## 💡 Core Idea

To build a long-term student publication system that:  
- Functions as a **digital archive** of weekly issues.  
- Allows me to **write, edit, and publish** directly from a custom CMS.  
- Stores posts in a **live database** (MongoDB Atlas).  
- Supports full **frontend + backend integration** with scalable hosting.  
- Eventually supports **multi-user contributions** and curated reading sections.

## ⚙️ Current Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js (React + TypeScript) | Fast, component-based UI |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Clean, modern, responsive design |
| **Backend** | Express.js + Node.js | API handling and routing |
| **Database** | MongoDB Atlas (Mongoose ORM) | Stores posts, metadata, and user info |
| **Hosting (Frontend)** | Netlify | Continuous deployment + custom domain |
| **Hosting (Backend)** | Render *(planned)* | Persistent backend hosting |

---

## 🚀 Current Progress (as of Nov 2025)

✅ Fully functional frontend  
✅ Connected backend (Express + Mongoose)  
✅ MongoDB Atlas cluster with first live document  
✅ Environment variables configured  
🚧 Next: backend deployment on Render + frontend data sync

## 🛠️ Upcoming Features

- **Admin Panel:**  
  A secure dashboard where I can log in, write, and publish new posts directly from the browser.  

- **Dynamic Articles:**  
  Frontend will automatically fetch new posts from MongoDB instead of static `.md` files.  

- **Banner System:**  
  Each post will have its own feature image, category tag, and summary for better presentation.  

- **Edition View:**  
  Combine all three newsletter streams (Friday Insights, Tech Pulse, World Watch) into one cohesive *weekly edition* layout.  

- **Search & Filters:**  
  Find posts by keyword, topic, or date — like a real online magazine archive.

## 🧭 Long-Term Vision

The project will evolve into a personal storytelling and tech-magazine ecosystem that:  
- Blends writing, design, and engineering.  
- Demonstrates how a student can build a media brand from scratch.  
- Eventually becomes a **portfolio piece**, a **blog**, and a **living resume** — all in one.
