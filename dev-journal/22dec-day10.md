# 📝 Day 10 – December 22, 2025

**Focus:** Winter Theme Glow-Up & Snowflake Shenanigans

Today was basically a snow day for the blog. I went full Elsa and gave the site a winter makeover that’s actually bright, festive, and (dare I say) magical.

---

## ❄️ Winter Theme Polish
- Swapped the background for a lighter, icier blue gradient. The whole site feels like it’s living inside a snow globe now.
- Banner got a color palette update to match the new winter vibes. No more clashing, just cozy.
- Finally fixed the “banner eats navbar” bug by adding proper padding. Navbar = safe, banner = happy.

## 🧊 Ice Crystal Category Cards
- Category cards now look like frosted glass with icy blue borders and gradients. If you lick your screen, I won’t judge (but maybe don’t).
- Added animated snowflake icons to each card. It’s subtle, but it makes the whole thing feel alive.
- Hover effect is now extra “frozen.” Move your mouse and watch the chill spread.

## 🌨️ Snowflake Visibility
- Made the snowflakes bigger, brighter, and gave them a blue glow + dark shadow. They finally pop against the background instead of hiding like shy penguins.
- Tweaked opacity and animation so the snowfall feels more magical and less like a CSS accident.

## 🧹 Code Cleanup
- Refactored the theme CSS so it’s not a tangled mess. Future me will thank me (I hope).
- Wrote everything down here so I don’t forget what “that one weird class” does.

---

## 🌟 Next Steps
- Add more festive particle effects for other themes (Halloween bats? Spring petals? Stay tuned).
- Keep making things more accessible and visually clear, because pretty is nothing if you can’t read it.
