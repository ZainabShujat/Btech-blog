# 📝 Day 18 – January 10, 2026

**Focus:** Upgrading Developer Tools, Custom Domain, and SEO Enhancements

Today I made some major upgrades to my developer toolkit and the blog's online presence:

- 🎓 **Got the GitHub Student Developer Pack** – unlocked a ton of free tools and credits for future projects.
- 🌐 **Bought a custom domain** for my portfolio and blog.
- 🏷️ **Added a subdomain** for this site, pointing it to the deployed app.
- 📈 **Linked the site to Google Analytics** for traffic tracking.
- 🔍 **Connected to Google Search Console** to monitor SEO and indexing.

These steps should help with discoverability, analytics, and future growth. Excited to see how the new setup impacts traffic and visibility!

**Takeaway:**
Investing in proper tools and SEO early pays off. The site is now more professional and ready for broader reach.
