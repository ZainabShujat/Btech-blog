# 📝 Day 8 — December 3, 2025  
## **Goodbye Netlify, Hello Vercel**

If Day 7 was chaos, Day 8 was clarity.

Netlify had been giving me mysterious “idk bestie” build errors for days.  
So I finally switched to Vercel — the platform Next.js literally prefers.

And suddenly everything… worked.

### 🚀 What Happened Today
- Connected GitHub → Vercel  
- Deployment succeeded instantly  
- No weird Netlify build failures  
- Routing smooth, fast, stable  
- My entire site finally felt **alive**  
- Vercel even fixed my tsconfig for me  

Honestly, this was the day the project **jumped a level**.

### 🌱 The Turning Point  
Seeing my site deployed and stable made something click inside me.

This wasn’t “Zee experimenting in a folder.”  
This was a **real publication** being born.

### 🧠 Takeaway  
**Deploy early. Deploy often.**  
Your project stops feeling like a draft once it goes live.
