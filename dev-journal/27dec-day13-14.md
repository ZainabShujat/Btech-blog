# 📝 Day 13 & 14 – December 25 & 27, 2025

**Focus:** Sitemap Sagas, Next.js App Router, and Build Battles

These two days were a wild ride through the land of SEO, XML, and Next.js build errors. I basically became a sitemap wizard and a Turbopack/webpack negotiator.

---

## 🗺️ Sitemap Adventures
- Built a dynamic sitemap.xml route in the App Router (`app/sitemap.xml/route.ts`) so Google can finally see my blog. XML never looked so good.
- Made sure the sitemap spits out the right format and `Content-Type: application/xml`—because Google is picky.
- Double-checked that `/sitemap.xml` is public, valid, and referenced in `robots.txt`. SEO points, please!

---

## 🤖 Googlebot Drama
- Submitted the sitemap in Google Search Console. Waited. Refreshed. Waited some more. Turns out, Google is on its own schedule.
- Debugged why Google wasn’t fetching it: checked file location, public access, and robots.txt. All good, just needed patience (and maybe a snack).

---

## 🛠️ Build Troubles (a.k.a. Turbopack vs. Webpack)
- Vercel builds started failing with mysterious Turbopack errors. Next.js 16+ really said “surprise!”
- Tried everything: removed invalid config, set environment variables, rewrote build scripts, and even tried to bribe the build gods (no luck).
- Learned that Turbopack is now default, and custom webpack configs are a no-go unless you force it. Switching between the two is basically a secret handshake now.

---

## 📝 Takeaway
- Documented every twist and turn so future me (or anyone else) can survive the Next.js build jungle.
- The blog is now more Google-friendly, and I’m way more battle-hardened.
