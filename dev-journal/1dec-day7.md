# 📝 Day 7 — December 1, 2025  
## **The Category Crisis & The Site Implosion**

Today was supposed to be simple.  
Just “add a few categories,” clean things up, reorganize posts.

Yeah… no.

**“New phone, who dis?”**

### 🌪️ What Actually Happened
- Added 8 brand new content categories  
- Updated folders, slugs, routes, imports  
- Next.js threw errors I had never met before  
- Pages randomly vanished  
- Localhost died dramatically  
- Compiler screamed for 20 straight minutes  

At one point I just stared at the terminal like it had betrayed the blood pact we never signed.

because the system had finally grown enough *to break*.

It wasn’t a toy project anymore.

**Architecture decisions matter.**  
And debugging structural changes is basically cardio.
