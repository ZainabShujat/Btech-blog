## 🧠 Dev Journal — Day 5 (4th Nov 2025)
**Focus:** Visual polish + emotional reset  

Today wasn’t about writing backend logic or APIs — it was about breathing life back into the project’s *feel*. I finally returned to “Notes From a B Tech Brain” after a few chaotic days, and I wanted it to look more like *me* again.  

### 🎨 Visual Wins  
- Adjusted the **hero gradient** from the old blue→pink to a sharper **blue→green** transition.  
- Experimented with depth using indigo/cyan/emerald tones to make it look *smart yet warm*.  
- Settled on a cleaner, calmer look that feels more “student creator” than “startup template.”  
- Deployed it successfully and saw the new gradient live on [btechbrain.netlify.app](https://btechbrain.netlify.app).  

### 🧩 Reflections  
- It hit me that good design isn’t just about color — it’s how it *feels* when you open the site.  
- I realized I’ve been rushing the technical part, forgetting that the *story* matters too.  
- This was the first time I really stopped to ask, “Does this look like me?”  

### 📌 Next Steps (Day 6 Plan — 9th Nov 2025)  
1. Fix the **GitHub MongoDB URI leak** (security alert flagged).  
2. Link the **backend to the live frontend**, so the site starts pulling posts from the database.  
3. Set up the **article editor**, where I can add my LinkedIn posts directly from the admin side.  

✅ **Day 5 Summary:**  
No big commits, but a crucial visual milestone.  
The blog looks like it has a pulse again — and so do I.
