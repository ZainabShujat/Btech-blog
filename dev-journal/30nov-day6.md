# 📝 Dev Journal — Day 6 (30th Nov 2025)
**Focus:** Returning after a long break + fixing layout + polishing the homepage

Today was one of those “I’m rusty but we move” days. After disappearing for almost a month (again 💀), I finally sat down to continue the blog project. And honestly, it felt good to be back touching code that’s actually *mine*.

## 🌟 What I Did Today
- **Got the homepage looking CLEAN.**  
  The post cards were comically wide — like dashboard-wide — so I fixed the grid, spacing, and max widths. Now the homepage finally looks like a real blog.

- **Banner issue fixed.**  
  The banner now appears properly above each article without weird cropping. Looks professional. Chef’s kiss.

- **Article text width aligned.**  
  I adjusted typography so the content matches the banner width visually. Super satisfying.

- **Added a mobile hamburger menu.**  
  The navbar was ghosting on mobile (rude), so now there’s a proper hamburger toggle. Stable and aesthetic.

- **Added more newsletter posts as Markdown.**  
  Finally began converting my LinkedIn editions into `.md` files. Surprisingly therapeutic.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Most frontend “problems” are just tiny CSS tweaks away from looking 10x better.  
- The project is no longer in the “foundation” stage — it’s officially in the “beautify and refine” era.  
- Markdown is actually a vibe. I like making structured content.

## 🧠 Mental State
Day 6 felt like returning to the gym after skipping for 20 days — awkward at first, but then it clicks.  
And seeing the homepage look *good* made me feel like:

**“Okay… this site is REAL now.”**

## 📌 Next Steps
- Fix the slug/filename mismatch issue  
- Add more newsletter editions  
- Consider making a Dev Journal section on the site  
- Add unique banners to each post

**Day 6 conclusion:**  
Today was all about polishing the visible parts — layout, spacing, responsiveness, vibe.  
And honestly?  
It’s starting to feel like a legit blog I’d be proud to share. 💛✨
