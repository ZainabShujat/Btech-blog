## Home Page UX Improvements
- Reordered home page sections: Hero, Recent Posts (with "See all" link to /browse), then Categories ("Browse by topic").
- Ensured only one Recent Posts section appears (removed duplicate).
- "See all" link now points to the explore page with search and pagination.

## Theming & Visual Polish
- Confirmed universal theme effects (e.g., Winter snowflakes, card effects) apply to all category cards.
- All recent visual and navigation feedback incorporated.

**Summary:**
Today's work focused on UX clarity, navigation, and visual consistency. The home page now guides users from Hero to Recent Posts to Categories, with a clear path to explore all posts. Theme effects remain robust and future-proof.
