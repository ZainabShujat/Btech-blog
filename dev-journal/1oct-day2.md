# Dev Journal — Day 2 (1st Oct 2025)

**Focus:** Backend mindset + ecosystem clarity  

Today’s session wasn’t so much about pushing code as it was about *laying the mental + technical groundwork* for what comes next.

---

## 🌟 Wins
- Crossed off **AOS Session 1** in the study plan (felt good about being consistent).  
- Dug deep into the backend ecosystem: **Node.js, Express, MongoDB vs MySQL, Mongoose, APIs, and Postman**.  
- Realized that my current blog project (Next.js + React + Tailwind) already has the **frontend foundation + Node runtime**, but I was missing a proper **database + API layer** to call it full stack.

## 🔍 Insights
- Backend ≠ scary black box → it’s just *“listen → fetch → reply.”*  
- MERN is specifically **MongoDB**, not MySQL (so if I use MySQL, I’m still full stack but not “MERN” per se).  
- MongoDB seems beginner-friendly compared to MySQL for JS projects → **Atlas** makes setup easier than running a local DB.  
- The toolkit on my system is actually complete:  
  - **Node.js** → engine  
  - **VS Code** → coding ground  
  - **Git Bash / GitHub** → version control  
  - **Postman** → test APIs  
  - **MySQL** (already installed) → SQL option if I want  
- Just need to add **MongoDB (local or Atlas)** to step into proper MERN dev.

## 🤯 Mindset Shift
Went from: *“Backend is terrifying and alien”* → to *“Okay, backend is just routes, APIs, and databases. I can actually do this.”*  

---

## 📌 Next Steps
1. Install **MongoDB (Atlas or local)** and set up first connection with Mongoose.  
2. Write a **baby Express server** (10 lines) that just says:  
   *Hello Zee, your server works 🚀*  
3. Build a “Users API” to Create/Read users → test it on Postman.  
4. Once comfortable, start linking it into the blog project so posts can come from DB instead of static files.

✅ Day 2 wasn’t about flashy commits — it was about *clearing the fog*.  
I know what pieces I need, what each app does, and where backend fits into the bigger picture. That’s huge.
