Yesterday, I was telling my childhood friend that I’ve been writing financial articles this month. She nodded, smiled, and asked, “Oh, so you know about the stock market?”

And I… froze. The silence that followed could’ve been traded on the NSE.

That one question humbled me. I realized I’d been spending weeks writing about budgeting and money management and yet, the moment someone mentioned stocks, my brain threw up the blue screen of confusion.

### The Financial Curriculum That Doesn’t Exist

College teaches us a lot, but not this. We’re learning how to code, design systems, run data queries, but no one explains how a CTC works or how to stop being scammed by “0% interest” credit card offers.

We’ve got entire semesters on operating systems, but not one lecture on how to operate our own finances.

It’s funny until it’s not. Because we’re all working hard to earn money someday, but barely anyone’s training us to handle it once it arrives.

### The Quiet Skills That Actually Matter

There are skills that pay loudly. The ones that fill your résumé and get you applause. Coding, design, trading, content creation.

And then there are the quiet ones. The ones that don’t trend on LinkedIn but hold your life together:

Managing your money  
Communicating clearly  
Learning how to learn  
Following through even when no one’s watching  

Honestly, writing this newsletter taught me more about discipline than any course ever did. There’s no grade for consistency, no certificate for showing up... but over time, it compounds, just like good investments.

### The Stock Market Moment, Revisited

When my friend asked that question, I laughed and said, “Okay fine, I don’t know the stock market… yet.”

Because maybe that’s the next quiet skill too — financial awareness. Not in the fancy “I’ll be a trader someday” sense, but just understanding where our money sleeps when we’re not looking.

Jobs will come and go. Tech will evolve. But if we can’t manage what we earn, we’ll always feel like we’re one decision away from losing control.

### The Bigger Picture

We don’t talk enough about the connection between peace of mind and financial literacy. It’s not about becoming wealthy, it’s about becoming aware. Knowing how to save, when to spend, and when to just breathe and let things unfold.

Maybe the next skill worth learning isn’t on our syllabus or in a certification course. It’s the ability to stay calm in chaos, to handle what we have wisely, and to keep building quietly, steadily, patiently.

Because the skills that pay quietly… stay the longest.
