Curiosity, Buzzwords, and a Month of Learning Together

August has been one big experiment. I started the month with FOMO. Every scroll through my feed was packed with buzzwords — AI, blockchain, crypto, and I thought, “Wait, am I the only one who doesn’t fully get this stuff?”

So instead of pretending, I decided to write my way through it. Learn as I go, break it down in simple terms, and share the messy parts along the way. There were hiccups, brain-freeze moments, and also those huge lightbulb flashes where I went, “wowww thissss is what it issss.” Looking back, I think that’s the best part, learning with you instead of trying to sound like I already knew it all.

Here’s how the month unfolded.

### Week 1: Tech Check Pt. 1

We started with AI, Cloud, Cybersecurity, and Data. These seemed like “big scary grown-up tech words” at first, but as I connected the dots, it became clear they’re simply the invisible framework behind almost everything we use.

The hiccup: realising I was overthinking AI as if it were sci-fi robots, when in fact it’s just systems trained on patterns.  
The wow moment: when I realised data isn’t just “boring numbers,” but the raw material that every modern system depends on.

### Week 2: Tech Check Pt. 2

Next came APIs, UX, Automation, and Web3. This week made me laugh at myself because APIs always felt like some mysterious backend magic. But really, they’re just bridges, a way for apps to talk to each other.

The hiccup: automation seemed dull at first, like a buzzword for lazy shortcuts.  
The wow moment: realising automation is actually how everything around us operates smoothly, from scheduled emails to large factory systems. Suddenly, it wasn’t dull at all.

And UX? That was the gentle reminder that all this tech only matters if it feels usable.

### Week 3: Blockchain and Beyond

This was the week I had the biggest “aha” moment. Blockchain sounded intimidating, like something only finance bros and whitepapers could explain. My hiccup here was mixing it up with crypto entirely. I thought they were the same thing at first.

The wow moment: when I pictured blockchain as a co-op game or a Google Doc where everyone can see edits, but no one can secretly delete history. That analogy just… clicked. From there, voting systems, supply chains, and even healthcare records all started to make sense in a blockchain lens.

### Week 4: Crypto and the Future of Digital Currency

Then came the memes and money. Crypto was wild because it wasn’t just about tech; it was also about culture. Dogecoin literally started as a joke, yet people actually made fortunes from it. And during the pandemic, when everything else went online, digital money suddenly didn’t feel so alien.

The hiccup: getting past the chaos of price swings, scams, and overhype.  
The wow moment: realising crypto isn’t just “magic internet coins,” but part of a bigger conversation about who controls money, how communities build trust, and how the future of payments might look.

### Takeaways From August

Looking back, the biggest lesson wasn’t in the definitions, but in the process. Learning tech isn’t about memorising buzzwords, it’s about demystifying them until they feel human.

For me, as a BTech student, these weren’t just weekly articles. They were like mini study sessions about the world I’ll soon be working in. I could see algorithms, security, design, and culture weaving together in real time. It reminded me that being curious is just as important as being skilled.

And here’s a funny bit: some people think I just copy-paste these articles. But the truth is, I sit with them, wrestle with them, edit them until they sound like me. Sometimes I even drop little easter eggs in the text, just to prove I’m really here with you, figuring this out 😂.

### Closing Thoughts

This month made me realise tech doesn’t have to feel distant or gatekept. It can be explained, questioned, or even joked about. Curiosity is contagious — and sharing what I learn with you only makes me want to dig deeper.

September is coming, and so is a new theme. I won’t spoil it just yet…

Thanks for sticking with me through August. Here’s to more hiccups, more wow moments, and more buzzwords made simple.
