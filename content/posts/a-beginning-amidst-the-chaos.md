Hi there!  
I’m Zainab Shujat — a second-year B. Tech student, an aspiring web developer, and someone trying to make sense of everything around her.

Over the past few months, I’ve felt a growing urge to do more. Not in the hustle culture sense — but in the **“wake up from passively watching life go by”** sense.

## The Scroll, the Stuck, and the Stirring

I’ve spent much time feeling idle, lost, and stuck in a loop of mindless scrolling.

Between college classes, coding problems, and the occasional existential crisis, it hit me just how overwhelming the constant stream of information is — and how hard it is actually to *process* any of it.

## A Bit About Me

I’m not part of college clubs. And sometimes, I feel disconnected from the “typical” campus life. I see others thriving in those environments, but I’ve never quite found my place there.

Instead, I’m finding my own way to explore interests, make an impact, and connect with others.  
And that’s how this newsletter came to life.

Not as a professional column.  
Not as a preachy blog.  
But as a **space to slow down, reflect, and process the chaos, together.**

## What This Newsletter Will Be

I’m building this as a weekly journal-meets-roundup, where I talk about:

- **Tech World Updates** – simplified takeaways on innovations, trends, tools  
- **Global Affairs** – important news, explained from my lens  
- **College Life Diaries** – honest slices of life  
- **Coding Journey** – what I’m learning, struggling with, or trying  
- **Soft Skills & Growth** – mindset, communication, clarity  
- **Occasional Deep Dives** – burnout, friendships, motivation

## Why I'm Doing This

Beyond all of that… this is personal.

In my first year, I felt lost — like I was floating through college without direction.

Now, I’m slowly rebuilding:

- Learning Python, C, and Java  
- Exploring web development  
- Getting back into digital art  
- Trying to stay focused academically  
- Growing soft skills I had neglected  

This newsletter?  
It’s part of that journey.

## The Heart of It

At the core, I’m just a student who wants to:

- support my family someday  
- grow without losing myself  
- understand the world instead of watching from the sidelines  

If you’ve ever felt like you’re consuming too much and processing too little, this might resonate with you.

## What’s Next?

Whether you're here out of curiosity or you clicked by accident, I’m truly glad you're here.  
Let’s take this one post at a time.

See you in Issue #2 — where I’ll talk about something I struggled with recently: *Why does news feel like it’s written for people who already know everything?*

Let’s break it down together.
