For the longest time, I thought keeping things in made me stronger. Maybe if I didn’t talk about what was hurting, it would pass faster. That if I just kept myself busy, moved on, acted “fine” — the weight would eventually lift.

But I’ve learned something lately: When you suppress emotions, they don’t disappear. They just find sneakier ways to resurface.

They come back as:

Random breakdowns when things get too quiet
exhaustion you can’t explain
irritability over the smallest things
a numbness that follows you around without you even noticing

In college, softness feels like a luxury.
Especially in tech — you’re expected to be on it all the time. Figure things out. Stay consistent. Be productive. Don’t lose your edge.

And if you’re struggling? You’re told to deal with it. Quietly. Efficiently. Without “making it a thing.” But here’s what I’ve realized:

Suppression isn’t strength. Silence isn’t grace. And being “low maintenance” isn’t a personality trait — it’s a trauma response.
Talking about what hurts isn’t weakness — it’s responsibility.
I used to think therapy wasn’t for people “like me.” That I didn’t need it enough. But sitting across someone who actually listens, no judgment, no unsolicited advice, teaches you something powerful.

Expression isn’t about being dramatic. It’s about learning how to carry your feelings better.

And sometimes, we all need help with that.

You don’t have to carry it all alone.
We all want to be seen, but we’re scared of being too much. We crave support, but we don’t want to burden anyone. We call ourselves “strong” for surviving alone… But isn’t it even braver to say:

“I’m not okay. I need someone right now.”
There’s no award for being emotionally invincible.

You don’t have to prove you’re handling it. You don’t have to act like nothing touches you. You don’t have to move through things alone, not always.

Let people in.
There are good people in this world. People who want to understand you. Who won’t use your softness against you. Give them a chance.

You’ve carried yourself through a lot. But you don’t have to keep doing it alone, just because you always have.

Here’s your reminder:
You’re allowed to break down.
You’re allowed to express.
You’re allowed to be both strong and soft.

Expression isn’t weakness. It’s wisdom. And it’s healing.
