Some semesters feel like chaos.  
This one felt like **confusion in disguise**.

We began thinking we had plenty of time.  
The last semester lasted seven months, so this one felt like a breather.  
A chance to slow down. Build something. Heal. Breathe.

Except… plot twist.

The exams were announced out of nowhere — suddenly it’s a three-week dash.  
No time to blink, no room to pause.  
Whatever you thought this semester would be, it isn’t that.

But the surprises didn’t end there.

Somewhere between the false calm and the real chaos, I found myself doing something unexpected:

I became a **therapy girl**.  
And I say that with pride.

# Therapy Changed the Game

For someone who always powered through problems whispering,  
**“It’s fine, I’ll figure it out,”**  
going to therapy felt like giving myself permission to *not* have it all together.

And honestly? It changed everything.

Therapy helped me:

- hold boundaries  
- zoom out  
- understand that some things were **never my fault**  

Here’s the biggest takeaway:

**Life is not that serious.**  
Not everything happening around us is about us.  
Overthinking is just our mind faking control when it really can’t.

Letting go of that illusion?  
Game-changer.

It made me softer —  
but stronger.

# When Friendships Test You Quietly

This semester tested my friendships in ways I didn’t expect.

Not with drama.  
Not with fights.  
But with **quiet emotional weight**.

That feeling where someone’s presence becomes your distraction.  
You’re trying to study, grow, build —  
but your heart is somewhere else.

And then comes the spiral:

**“I should know better.”**  
**“Why am I like this?”**  

But therapy taught me something powerful:

You’re allowed to outgrow old coping habits —  
even the ones that told you emotional pain = weakness,  
even the ones that taught you to show up for everyone *before* yourself.

# We’re Not Meant to Carry Everything Alone

Some of us have known abandonment.  
Some of us know what it feels like to depend on the wrong people.  
So trusting again feels like walking a tightrope.

But that doesn’t mean everyone will leave.

There are good people in this world —  
people who hold space when you can’t hold it yourself,  
people who don’t expect your strength to look like silence.

Let yourself give them a chance.  
Let yourself rely on others —  
so you don’t end up quietly crushing under things no one else even knows you’re carrying.

# This Semester Isn’t About Results

It’s not about routines either.

It’s about **reminders**:

- Life will throw curveballs.  
- Even when you're behind, you can still catch up.  
- Clarity isn’t a switch — it’s a messy, slow arrival.  

So if your plans didn’t work out, maybe it’s because you were meant to outgrow them.

If you got derailed, maybe life wanted you to feel first — not fix.

Growth doesn’t always show up in grades, streaks, or achievements.  
Sometimes it shows up in how you handle emotional clutter.  
Sometimes it shows up in how you begin again.

So yes —  
this wasn’t the plan.

But maybe it was the one you needed.
