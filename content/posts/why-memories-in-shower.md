This almost always happens when I’m not thinking about anything important.

I’ll be in the shower, or in the kitchen, doing something that doesn’t really need my attention. My hands are busy. My head isn’t. And then suddenly I’m not where I am anymore.

I’m somewhere else. Some random moment from years ago. Not a big one. Not a life-changing one. Just a normal slice of time I didn’t know I’d kept.

It never feels intentional. I don’t go looking for it. It just shows up, already complete, like it was waiting for me to stop paying attention.

## The confusion always comes after
The first thing I do is try to justify it.

I look around mentally, searching for a connection. Did something here remind me of that moment? A sound? A smell? A thought I missed?

Most of the time, I can’t find anything convincing.

The memory feels too specific to be random, but too disconnected to explain. And that in-between is what makes it uncomfortable. I’m left holding a moment from the past without knowing why it was handed to me now.

## Apparently, this isn’t just a personal quirk
At some point, I found out that this isn’t just something I do.

Psychologists actually have a name for it. They call these involuntary autobiographical memories. Memories that surface on their own, without us trying to retrieve them.

They tend to show up when we’re doing things that don’t demand much attention. Activities that are familiar enough for the body to handle on autopilot.

Which explains why it happens in the shower. Or while commuting. Or while washing dishes. The brain finally has some room to wander, and it uses that room in ways we don’t fully control.

## Knowing the explanation doesn’t make it feel less strange
Even after learning this, the experience doesn’t turn mechanical.

It still feels personal.

The memory doesn’t arrive labelled as “triggered by an environmental cue.” It arrives as a feeling, a scene, a brief displacement. And often, it isn’t even an important memory. Just something ordinary that mattered very little at the time.

That makes me wonder how much of our past is still active somewhere in the background. How many moments we assume we’ve forgotten are just… quiet.

Not gone. Just waiting.

## The part that still doesn’t make sense to me
What I keep coming back to is how selective these memories are.

Why this one and not another? Why now and not yesterday?

Sometimes they come with emotion. Sometimes they don’t. Sometimes they fade quickly. Sometimes they linger longer than I’d like.

There’s no clear pattern that I can see. And maybe there isn’t supposed to be one. Maybe the mind doesn’t retrieve memories the way we expect it to, neatly or logically.

Maybe it retrieves them the way it retrieves dreams. Loosely. Associatively. Slightly sideways.

I don’t think these moments are trying to tell us anything.

I don’t think every random memory has meaning, or that it’s a sign we should analyse our lives. But I do think they reveal something quietly unsettling and kind of beautiful at the same time.

The present isn’t sealed off from the past. It’s thinner than we think.

When everything goes quiet, when we stop filling every second with something to do or something to consume, old pieces of ourselves find small gaps to slip through.

And maybe the shower isn’t special at all. Maybe it’s just one of the few places where we finally stop keeping those gaps closed.
