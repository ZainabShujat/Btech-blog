This month began underwhelming.  
I thought third year would roll in like any other semester — steady, predictable —  
but the universe had other plans.

The curriculum shifted.  
Suddenly every test carries more weight.  
Sections reshuffled.  
Friend groups found new shapes.  

What began flat turned into something busy and unpredictable.

# Small Wins, Small Losses

I got offered two website projects…  
and both slipped away at the last moment.  
That stung.

But in the middle of it, I built something of my own:  
a small sibling-love app.  
Tiny idea, tiny project — but it felt big because it was **mine**.

College added its own twist:  
the new mini project requirement is already pushing me to think differently.

And personally, this newsletter?  
It’s growing into something more than words —  
I want it to hold both my writing *and* my code.

# The Big Leap

The biggest shift this month:  
I’m participating in the **Smart India Hackathon**.

Nervous? Yes.  
Excited? Also yes.

It feels like the kind of milestone I wouldn’t have imagined at the start of the year.

# Quiet Growth

Somewhere between all this bustle, I noticed something quieter:

My anxiety didn’t win as many battles.

A few testing situations came,  
and instead of spiralling,  
I stayed calm.

That may sound small to someone else —  
but to me, it’s proof that therapy, reflection, and time  
are slowly changing me.

# Why This Newsletter Was Quiet

If you were wondering why I didn’t post much this month —  
this is why.

September took my flat expectations and spun them into a whirlwind.

Still, I wanted to show up at least once,  
to write this down,  
and to leave a small record of how things felt in the middle of it all.

Maybe that’s the real reason this piece exists:  
It’s the last Friday of the month,  
and I didn’t want to lose touch with my writing voice.

# Looking Ahead

October feels like a reset.

I’m leaning toward themes around:

- financial knowledge  
- interview prep  
- the practical skills we’re all quietly trying to figure out  

Still tech, still reflective —  
but more grounded in the everyday challenges we’re stepping into.

Here’s to October,  
and hopefully to more stories worth telling.
