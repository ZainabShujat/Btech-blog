## Welcome to World Watch

Hello everyone, and welcome to the **very first World Watch** from *Notes From a B.Tech Brain*.

Let’s dive into this week’s headlines.

## 1. Terror Attack in Pahalgam: India on High Alert

A tragic attack occurred near **Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir**, where terrorists opened fire on an Indian Army convoy.  
Three soldiers lost their lives, and several others were injured.

Initial intelligence suggests involvement of **Pakistan-based terror groups**.

Following the attack:

- Border security was tightened  
- Diplomatic communication became tense again  
- High-level reviews were initiated  

It’s heartbreaking to see violence repeatedly erode hopes for peace. Security isn’t just policy — it’s about lives, families, and futures.

## 2. Water Tensions Rise Between India & Pakistan

After the Pahalgam attack, India signaled potential changes to the **Indus Waters Treaty**, the historic water-sharing agreement between India and Pakistan.

Reports suggest:

- India may review water commitments  
- Adjustments to river flows are being considered  
- Pakistan is calling for international intervention  

Any shift here affects agriculture, drinking water access, and geopolitical stability across the region.

The terror strike caused ripples across India’s financial markets.

- Defence stocks **surged** on expectations of increased spending  
- Broader indices like Nifty and Sensex traded **cautiously**

These shifts remind us how interconnected — and fragile — the global economy truly is.

Although media attention has reduced, the war in Ukraine continues relentlessly.

Recent updates:

The world may look away, but the conflict is far from over.
