There’s this quiet pressure that follows you around when you’re in tech, especially while you’re still at university.  
Everyone seems to be achieving so much — internships, startups, daily LeetCode streaks, dev logs, networking.  
It's as if everyone else is on a never-ending productivity high.

And then there’s you.

Maybe you’re still figuring things out.  
Maybe you’re showing up every day but don’t have anything “impressive” to show yet.  
Maybe you’re just tired.

Yet your mind whispers:  
**Am I doing enough?**

For those of us living in hostels, far from home, the pressure hits even harder.  
You’re already battling homesickness, trying to stay afloat, eating mess food (iykyk), and your biggest motivation is making your family proud.

When you feel stuck, that guilt adds another layer — like you’re letting them down too.

It’s astonishing how quickly ambition becomes anxiety.

# The Comparison Trap

All it takes is a scroll through LinkedIn or a “day in the life” reel.

Suddenly you’re questioning:

- Should I wake up earlier?  
- Should I build more?  
- Should I post more?  
- Should I be juggling five things at once?

You want to grow.  
You want to win.  
But it starts feeling like you're in a race you never signed up for.

# The Hustle Isn’t the Whole Story

We glorify hustle so much that we forget:

- Rest is part of growth.  
- Ambition doesn’t mean burnout.  
- Productivity isn’t 24/7 electricity.

And it definitely doesn’t mean you owe people output just because they believe in you.  
They believe in **you**, not a version of you that never pauses.

# What I’m Learning

You can be ambitious **and still slow**.  
You can be productive **and still rest**.  
You can be homesick **and still strong**.

Not every success story needs to be loud.

Sometimes it’s quiet:
- Showing up for yourself  
- Building at your own pace  
- Keeping the faith  
- Doing small things that matter to *you*

# You’re Allowed

You’re allowed to be proud of the little things.  
You’re allowed to take breaks.  
You’re allowed to breathe.

Growth isn’t a race.  
It’s a rhythm — yours.
