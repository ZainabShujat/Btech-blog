### The Mid-Month Broke Chronicles

By the second week of every month, someone in my group is broke. Someone’s counting coins for chai, someone’s stretching Maggi packets, and someone’s asking, “Can we split the cab fare three ways?” It’s become a ritual now — the rhythm of college life, measured not by classes but by bank balances.

### My Version of Broke

Being a day scholar means I get off slightly easier. No hostel rent, no mess card battles, no PG panic texts to parents. My version of broke looks different. It’s those tiny moments — realizing pocket money quietly disappeared into snacks, random college fundraisers, and unplanned auto rides home. It’s the kind of broke that’s inconvenient but survivable.

### The Hostel Economy

My friends, though, live a different financial drama altogether. By the second or third week, half of them are surviving on Maggi, bread omelettes, and creative rationing. Some keep saying, “I’ll manage till the 28th,” like it’s a mantra. Others send anxious texts to parents that start with “hey, um, small problem…” By mid-month, we’ve all learned to share, lend, and laugh it off — because what else can you really do?

### The Messi Emergency

Everything goes fine for a while, until boom — news drops that Messi is coming to India this December, and suddenly every guy in my circle has a new financial emergency. “Bro, we have to go.” Just like that, weeks of rationing go out the window. Money that didn’t exist yesterday suddenly exists for match tickets, travel plans, and the chance to see a legend live. Somehow, no one ever has money for laundry, but everyone finds it for a once-in-a-lifetime moment.

### Lessons in Survival Math

At nineteen or twenty, we’re all still figuring out what money really means. It’s not just numbers on a screen; it’s independence, pressure, freedom, guilt, and sometimes, joy.

Watching everyone wrestle with their budgets got me thinking about how we learn money — not from finance books, but from life. It even nudged me to try something small. Not that financial tracker apps don’t already exist, but I wanted to make one that felt like us — chaotic, hopeful, and halfway disciplined. So I made a tiny personal project: a mini financial tracker app. It wasn’t about reinventing the wheel. It was about curiosity, about seeing if I could turn our everyday mess into something slightly more mindful.

### Finding Meaning in the Mess

And maybe that’s what college is teaching me more than anything: survival math. Learning how to say no, when to treat yourself, when to ask for help, and when to laugh off the chaos. The numbers never really balance, not on the screen, not in life, but somehow, we keep figuring it out.

Money will always be messy. But maybe growing up is learning to find meaning in that mess.
