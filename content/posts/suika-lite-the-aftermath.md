In the [last edition](https://btechbrain.vercel.app/post/the-making-of-suika-lite), I wrote about how Suika Lite came to life — a four-hour challenge that turned into a week of fruits, physics, and far too many browser tabs. This one’s about what stayed after the code stopped running.

## What Stayed With Me

When the screen finally went still, the silence felt heavier than I expected. After a week of debugging, drawing, testing, and swearing at viewport issues, the quiet was almost too much.

I didn’t post about it right away. I just stared at the final build for a while, replaying it again and again... half to admire it, half because I didn’t know what to do next. It was strange, that post-project calm. You spend days inside a thing, and when it’s done, the world doesn’t clap; it just goes on. I cannot tell the number of times I thought I was being overhyped about it.

But that’s where the reflection begins, I think. That soft in-between space where you start to see what the work actually changed in you.

## The Universe’s Little Nudge

A day after sharing my Suika — Physics Prototype on LinkedIn, an engineer from QuriousBit Games reached out after seeing the post. What followed were hours of conversation about game development, DSA, college life, and work culture. He even offered to refer my profile directly to their CTO for an internship. But my college doesn't allow On-site internships in the 3rd year of B. Tech... so I just had to pretend that I'm nonchalant and chill about it 😭.

It wasn’t just about opportunity; it was one of those rare, full-circle moments where curiosity quietly pays off. The same late-night fruit collisions that began as an experiment ended up sparking a real industry connection. It still feels surreal, how something built out of pure curiosity could open a door to the very world it was inspired by.

## A Small Afterthought

If there’s one thing this little project taught me (besides a lot of physics), it’s how deceptive “simple” games can be. What looks like fruit casually merging on screen is actually a carefully balanced web of forces, collisions, and tiny equations, and every change in one number changes the whole feel of the game.

Somewhere in the middle of it all, I ended up learning not just game development, but also how to plan it around real life. In between study sessions, chai breaks, and whatever subject I was pretending to revise that day. I learned to squeeze progress between classes and to debug while half-asleep.

So yes, I made a whole game during my ST week. And yes, there were tests in between. Please pray it didn’t mess up my marks. 😉

Either way, I’m glad it exists. It’s proof that sometimes you don’t need a massive plan to create something real. Just a few hours, a tiny question, and enough curiosity to see what happens next.

Sometimes, a four-hour challenge teaches you more than a full semester.
