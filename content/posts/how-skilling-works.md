Hey you — the one with eight tabs open on “how to learn XYZ in 2025.”  
This one’s for us both.

We talk about skilling like it’s a one-size-fits-all concept, but the reality is very different.  
There are **multiple types of skilling**, each serving a different purpose depending on where you are in your journey. Whether you want to stay relevant, switch paths, or simply figure out where to begin, understanding these types helps you stop the scroll and *finally start*.

# 🔁 Reskilling

This is when what you currently know isn’t enough for where you want to go.  
Think of it as **pivoting**.

Example:  
Switching from mechanical engineering to full-stack development?  
That’s reskilling.

---

# ⛓️ Cross-skilling

Learning **adjacent skills** to become more versatile.

If you’re a designer → learn basic frontend.  
If you’re into DSA → add system design.  

It makes you harder to replace — and way more valuable.

---

# 📈 Upskilling

Taking what you already know and going **one level higher**.

You know Java? → learn Spring Boot.  
You write content? → learn SEO strategy.  

It’s growth without starting from zero.

---

# 💡 Expert-skilling

Going **deep** into one niche and owning it.

You’re not just good — you become *the person* for that thing.  
This is where specialists shine, and where people come looking for you.

---

# Why This Matters

The industry — and even creators, founders, and hiring leads on LinkedIn —  
is done waiting for you to have a perfect degree and a miracle.

They’re focusing on:

- what you *can do*  
- what you’re *building*  
- who you’re *becoming*

So the question isn’t:

**“What should I learn?”**  
It’s:

**“What kind of learning do I need right now?”**

# Mini Thought

Even if you feel like you “wasted” your first year of college (hi, same),  
your redemption arc doesn’t need the perfect masterplan.

It needs one thing:

**A consistent decision to start now.**

You’re not late.  
You’re right on time to surprise yourself.
