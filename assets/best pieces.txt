There are days when I realise I don’t feel nineteen the way nineteen is supposed to feel. Not because I’m unusually wise or sorted, I’m not, but because I’ve been thinking a little too hard, a little too early. And I know I’m not the only one. A lot of girls carry this quiet, internal tiredness that doesn’t match the number on their birthday cake.

Some of it comes from the way girls are raised here. There’s no big announcement, no formal lesson. You just absorb certain expectations. You’re told to be sensible long before anyone explains what that means. You’re expected to read situations, avoid mistakes, adjust smoothly, apologise first, and manage things well. Boys get the freedom to experiment and figure life out as they go; girls get nudged into responsibility before they’ve even had a chance to enjoy being young.

It doesn’t turn you bitter, but it does make you older on the inside. You start thinking before reacting, analysing before enjoying, managing before relaxing. Not because life is dramatic, but because you’re trained to anticipate instead of simply experience. Somewhere in all of that, girlhood gets trimmed down without you noticing.

A lot of that early maturity also comes from family roles. In households like ours, elder siblings — especially sisters — end up becoming something between a guide, a buffer, and a second parent. Mine wasn’t always like that. When we were younger, she was the calm, composed, quietly steady one: the type who stayed unbothered even when everyone else was in overdrive.

But adulthood reshapes even the softest people. Responsibilities started piling up faster than she could slow them down. Now she still steps in first when things get chaotic, but she does it with commentary, reminders, irritation, and a running list of things that “should have been handled better.” And honestly, she’s allowed that. When life hands you roles you never planned for, even the calmest person starts sounding like the practical one.

Watching her juggle that mix of composure and exhaustion taught me more about adulthood than my age has. I learned parts of maturity from seeing how even grounded people can get worn out. Some of my own “early growing up” probably came from realising that if adulthood can tire her out, it’s okay if it tires me too.

That’s how you suddenly find yourself nineteen with a mind that feels older. Not because life broke you, but because you’ve been aware for too long — aware of emotions, reactions, expectations, and the social rules you didn’t ask for but still follow. It’s a quiet kind of aging, the sort that settles into your thoughts long before it shows on your face.

But lately, I’ve been learning that I don’t have to live in that seriousness all the time. You’re allowed to feel lighter than your upbringing trained you to be. You’re allowed to laugh too loudly, to be silly without embarrassment, to enjoy moments without analysing them. You’re allowed to be young, properly, without guilt.

Growing up too fast doesn’t mean you lost your childhood; it just means you have to make space for softness now. Not childishness... just softness. Joy that doesn’t need interpretation. Moments that don’t need managing. Youth that isn’t squeezed into leftover hours.

I think that’s what I want now: a little less awareness, a little more ease. Not to undo the maturity I’ve collected, but to balance it. To let the nineteen-year-old inside me exist without always feeling forty.

Looking Smart vs Being Curious

November 16, 2025
There was a time when being a nerd simply meant being deeply interested in something. Not aesthetic. Not status. Not a personality template. Just genuine curiosity — the kind that quietly pulled you in for hours without anyone noticing. It wasn’t pretty or poetic. It didn’t come with filters or desk setups. It was private, sometimes even embarrassing, and that was exactly what made it real.

Somewhere along the way, that meaning shifted. “Being nerdy” became a look. A vibe. A carefully curated idea of studiousness — clean desks, colour-coded notes, productivity playlists, laptops posed next to lattes. The internet romanticised learning so much that the performance of intelligence now travels further than the effort behind it. You can seem like someone who reads without turning a page. You can “look like a coder” without touching the logic. It takes fifteen seconds to appear dedicated, and years to actually be.

Meanwhile, real nerdiness looks nothing like the online version. It’s someone in a hoodie, half-awake, stuck on the same bug for three hours. It’s rereading the same paragraph because your brain tapped out the first four times. It’s notes that aren’t pretty, desks that aren’t tidy, and curiosity that isn’t aesthetic. It’s confusion, stubbornness, obsession, and the strange comfort of being immersed in something nobody else sees value in.

There’s a gender angle buried inside this too. A guy who’s nerdy is usually viewed as focused, dedicated, “into his thing.” A girl who’s nerdy often gets read as trying too hard or performing intelligence. The same seriousness that’s admirable in men becomes suspicious in women — as if curiosity must be constantly proven, not simply lived. It creates a strange pressure where girls who genuinely care about something end up wondering if they look like they’re acting.

And that’s the saddest part: the real nerds — the ones who actually love what they love — start doubting themselves because their passion doesn’t look clean enough to fit the online version. They think their mess is a flaw. They think their frustration means they aren’t smart enough. They think their lack of aesthetic somehow makes their interest less valid. But this is what real learning has always looked like: uneven, exhausting, deeply personal, and rarely pretty.

The truth is, curiosity has never needed to be curated. It doesn’t need to be defended or displayed. It shows up when no one is watching. It stays long after the aesthetic fades. It keeps you awake at 2 a.m. without anyone clapping for it. Looking smart lasts for a moment, long enough to post. Being curious lasts in habits, in effort, in the hours you give to something, even when it refuses to make sense.

And maybe that difference — the quiet, unshareable part — is what still makes real passion stand on its own. The world can keep its aesthetic. The rest of us are here for the truth of the thing we love, even when it doesn’t photograph well.

The Quiet Math of Equality in STEM

November 9, 2025
The Surface of Equality
When I joined engineering, the ratio was almost comical, one girl for every ten boys. Nobody found that surprising; it’s just how things are. Someone joked that our batch didn’t even need a separate girls’ washroom. Everyone laughed.

It didn’t bother me at first. We were here, learning the same subjects, writing the same exams; that felt like progress. But as time went on, I started to notice how equality doesn’t always mean what it looks like on paper. You can be in the class, the team, the system, and still not really in it.

Now that more women are joining STEM, the conversation has changed too. It’s no longer “Can women do this?” It’s “Why do they get so much credit for doing it?” You hear things like, “Why equal pay when men can work longer hours?” or “Women get promoted faster these days.” Nobody says it as an insult; it’s just casual math. But it never feels simple when you’re on the other end of it.

Inside the Classroom
Even in hackathons or projects, I’ve seen teams add a girl because it “looks balanced.” Not because she’s the best fit, but because the form says “at least one female member.” It’s supposed to sound progressive, but sometimes it just feels like a checkbox. You can sense when you’re chosen for your presence instead of your perspective.

And then there’s the quieter stuff — the interruptions, the over-explanations, the lab banter that pauses when you walk in. The times you make a point that gets repeated louder by someone else and suddenly counts as valid. Nobody calls it discrimination, but you still walk out of the room feeling smaller than when you walked in.

Even the language shifts. Men are driven. Women are too emotional for tech. The same passion looks different depending on who it comes from.

After a while, you start to internalize it. You catch yourself hesitating before speaking up, double-checking if your idea is “obvious,” wondering if you’re being “too confident.” Not because you don’t trust yourself, but because you’ve learned to expect disbelief. Every success comes with a quiet question: was it skill, or was it tokenism?

The jokes don’t help either. “You girls have it easy, you’ll just get married anyway.” “Why stress about jobs? You’ll be in the kitchen.” It’s all “light-hearted,” apparently. So you laugh too, because explaining why it stings would just make you the “serious” one again.

Even professors carry traces of the old bias in new words. My HOD once told me to stay “extra focused” since ours is an all-female household. It wasn’t cruel... maybe even meant kindly — but it carried that familiar undertone: women need to try harder, stay sharper, prove more.

Beyond the Campus Walls
And it doesn’t end at college. I’ve heard stories from seniors, women working in the same industry we’re trying to enter. Stories of being side-eyed when promoted, or having their work quietly credited to someone else.

Stories of emotional exhaustion — and sometimes, of something worse. The kind that makes you realise harassment isn’t always a headline. It can be a colleague standing too close, a boss who calls too late, or a culture that pretends not to notice.

Somewhere between those stories and our own daily adjustments, you start to see the full picture, how equality can exist statistically, but not socially.

The Quiet Kind of Solidarity
And yet, there’s something that keeps most of us going. That quiet, wordless solidarity. The small look you exchange across the lab when someone says something off. The soft message after class that says, “You okay?” It’s not about confrontation; it’s about being seen.

We don’t need grand gestures or saviours. We don’t even need to be praised for staying strong. We just need fairness, the kind that doesn’t need to be defended.

Equality shouldn’t feel like a debate that keeps changing shape. It should just feel normal.

Representation was step one. Respect is the one we’re still earning.

November 2, 2025
The Trip That Should Have Been Simple
When five of us planned a short visit to Delhi, our parents hesitated. We had promised to go only during the day, to stay together, to keep our phones on. None of it really helped. The unease was still there, quiet but unmistakable.

I carried a pepper spray in my bag without even thinking about it. It wasn’t dramatic. Just what you do. We shared our locations, kept answering calls, and texted every time we reached somewhere. Our parents finally relaxed only when we were all back home that evening.

At the time, it felt like overprotection. Now it feels like context. The older we get, the more their worry starts to make sense. We begin to see the world through that same cautious lens, and suddenly, all those rules that once felt restrictive start to look like survival instincts.

The Lessons That Arrive Quietly
It starts around adolescence. No one announces it, but the air changes. Family gatherings get smaller for you. You’re told not to wander, to stay near your mother, to avoid certain people without asking too many questions.

And even when nothing is said, you notice it in your mother’s eyes. The way her hand rests on your arm when you walk through a crowded room. The way she glances at certain uncles. It’s not paranoia. It’s memory. It’s an experience that’s been passed down because it had to be.

At 13, it felt unfair. Now I know it was her way of saying something she couldn’t say out loud: danger doesn’t always come from outside. Sometimes it sits right next to you, smiling politely.

The Math of Being Careful
That same carefulness follows us everywhere. Every outing, every ride, every walk comes with its own mental checklist.

In a shared auto, someone’s arm brushes against mine, and I freeze. I don’t know what to do. I can’t shout. I can’t take out pepper spray. It might have been an accident. It might not have. So I just sit there, trying to breathe normally while my mind keeps replaying what just happened.

Someone might say, “Why didn’t you say anything?” as if it’s that simple. But in the moment, it isn’t. The body reacts before logic does. It locks up. It freezes. And behind that silence is another quick thought that men rarely understand: what if he gets angry, what if it turns into a scene, what if I get blamed for overreacting.

So I do nothing. And then I hate myself for doing nothing. And that memory sticks, like a warning label I didn’t ask for but can’t peel off.

The Weight That Doesn’t Show
After a while, the alertness becomes automatic. I walk faster without realising it. I keep one earphone out in cabs. I check the mirrors. I send my location even when no one asks for it.

It stops feeling like fear and starts feeling like a habit. Like growing up means learning how to stay alert, not how to feel safe.

But it’s heavy work. Being careful all the time changes the way you experience everything. Even joy feels rationed. We start to measure freedom by the amount of risk it entails.

At this point, I don’t think I know a single girl who hasn’t lived some version of this—some moment of freezing, shrinking, pretending, calculating. It’s not rare. It’s routine. And that might be the most exhausting part.

Somewhere along the line, I stopped asking why my parents worry so much. I just started worrying, too.

What We Carry, and What We Deserve
This isn’t about weakness. It’s about the way girlhood quietly becomes self-defence. It’s about how fear and love get tangled together inside our parents, and how we inherit both.

It’s about how unfair it is that a simple trip, a ride home, or a day out needs this much planning. We have to think five steps ahead just to exist safely.

We’re not asking to be admired for being cautious. We’re just asking for a world where our mothers could finally breathe easy when we step outside. A world where careful can one day be replaced with carefree. Where coming home safe isn’t a small victory, but just the way the day ends.

When Passion Meets Paycheck
Zainab Shujat

October 26, 2025
Somewhere between our first few college lectures and the chaos of third year, everything started to change.

The first two years felt like baby adulthood. We were technically grown up, but life still felt padded. There was time to breathe, laugh too much, submit assignments late, and pretend that the next semester would somehow be more productive. We didn’t know yet how heavy things could get.

Then suddenly, reality showed up with projects, resumes, and job portals that looked like alien languages. We started applying to every opportunity we came across, barely reading what the job was about. Most of the time, we just clicked “apply” and hoped someone, somewhere, would notice our almost-empty resumes.

It wasn’t confidence. It was desperation, that quiet hope of being seen, of being picked, of proving that we could figure it out along the way.

And for those who already had good resumes, the thought wasn’t “I hope I get picked.” It became “I hope this one actually pays.” That’s when it hit - college isn’t just about learning anymore. It’s also about trying to earn, to survive, and to stay sane in the process.

The Third-Year Reality Check
The third and fourth years feel completely different from the first two. Those early semesters were slow and soft, full of friendships and half-serious ambitions. But now everything is stacked up on top of each other.

Classes, DSA, mini-projects, internships, placements, side skills. We can’t drop any of them, but we can’t handle them all either. And somewhere in between, we start thinking about money.

Not in a greedy way — just in a growing-up way. Asking our parents for money starts to feel awkward. Not because they make us feel that way, but because we want to pay for our own coffee, our own autos, our own random expenses. We want to earn a little, to feel capable, to not have to ask.

The Job Hunt Blur
When we finally start applying for internships or part-time work, it’s chaos. Half the time, we don’t even know what the job actually involves. We just want something that sounds fancy enough to put on our CVs.

But some of those internships don’t pay at all. And the ones that do? Barely cover our weekend snacks.

We laugh it off, call it “exposure,” and keep moving. Everyone’s doing the same thing — trying to look like we’ve got it together, when really, all of us are learning on the go.

Balancing the Noise
This is the part no one warns you about: balancing everything at once. Academics, projects, skill-building, maybe a personal hobby or two. It’s exhausting. But it’s also strangely grounding.

Because this is when we start figuring out what actually matters, what kind of work feels like a chore, and what kind feels like purpose. What we do because we want to, and what we do because we think we should.

It’s the first real glimpse of adulthood. Messy, confusing, but kind of beautiful in its own way.

When Passion Starts Paying
The first time we get paid for something we love, it feels unreal. We stare at the number for way too long. It’s not even about the amount, it’s about what it represents - the first sign that maybe, we’re getting somewhere.

But then comes the pressure. What used to be fun suddenly has expectations attached to it. Passion becomes responsibility. We start worrying about being consistent, about doing enough, about not losing what made us start in the first place.

And that’s when it clicks... doing what we love doesn’t make it easy. It just means we care enough to keep doing it even when it’s hard.

Finding the Balance
Maybe this is what growing up really is. Learning to balance everything - college, work, passions, people, without dropping ourselves in the middle.

I don’t think the goal is to choose between passion and paycheck. It’s to find the rhythm where both can exist without one swallowing the other.

At the end of the day, we don’t just want to earn from what we love. We want to still love it when we earn from it.

🍉 The Making of Suika Lite
Zainab Shujat

B. Tech (CSE-AIML) student | Aspiring Writer and Web Dev | Author of "Notes From a B. Tech Brain"| MERN


October 22, 2025
It started in the ST week, that quiet middle stretch when everything feels paused but not really. Classes slow down, teachers go easier, and suddenly there’s this tiny pocket of time you don’t know what to do with. I remember sitting there with nothing in particular to study that evening, half-bored, half-restless, and thinking: “What if I try to make a game in four hours?”

That’s how most of my chaos begins — one throwaway thought that sounds harmless at first.

I wasn’t planning to build anything big. Just a blank HTML file, a cup of chai that went cold too quickly, and two libraries, p5.js and matter.js, that I barely understood yet. 

Article content
The goal wasn’t even a goal. It was more of a test: could I make something fall, bounce, behave like it had a mind of its own? But curiosity is my worst best habit. Once I open a file, I can’t stop.

The First Memory
This wasn’t the first time I’d made something that moved. Long before this prototype, there was a strawberry clicker game: built on MIT App Inventor, all block-coded, with a bright pink background and strawberries popping on tap. My father tried it once. He laughed, kept tapping, watching the screen fill up while I sat beside him, quietly delighted that something I’d built actually worked.

That moment never left. It wasn’t about the logic or the layout. It was that small, ridiculous rush of “I made this move because I told it to.” I think that’s where Suika Lite really began... not in code, but in that memory.

Watching and Wondering
I’ve actually been curious about Suika Game since 2023. It kept appearing in my feed — that slow tumble of fruits that somehow looked both relaxing and intense. I’d watch gameplay videos just to see how the fruits behaved: the soft collisions, the way the bowl overflowed like it was teasing you to keep trying.

Then came Code Bullet. I’ve followed him for years; I love his brand of nerdiness and chaos, that unfiltered “let’s make an AI do something absurd and see what happens” energy. Somewhere between his spaghetti-code humour and his clever nonsense, I think I inherited a bit of that too. There are a few other creators I quietly adore for the same reason — the ones who treat code like art, who build things for the sheer joy of making.

So when I finally sat down during the ST week and thought, “let’s try building a Suika,” it wasn’t really spontaneous. It had been simmering for over a year.

The Four-Hour Challenge
I told myself I’d stop once a few circles fell correctly. That was the deal.

At first, it was just random geometry. A few circles, a makeshift gravity setting, nothing fancy. Then I gave them colour. Then I gave them bounce. Then I gave them the ability to roll. And then almost accidentally... two of them touched and merged.

I froze for a second because I hadn’t actually written that logic intentionally. It just happened because the physics engine was in a good mood. I stared at the screen, whispered “huhhh,” and then started smiling like an idiot.

Article content
a snapshot of the early game
That’s when it clicked. The line between experiment and project vanished instantly.

Four hours became eight. Then eight became the whole week. And I stopped keeping track of time the moment it started feeling alive.

Building Suika Lite
By the end of that week, it had a name — Suika Lite. Not because I wanted it to sound fancy, but because it really was a lighter version of the real game — a softer, smaller, Zee-style Suika.

I didn’t want to copy the original. I wanted to make something that carried its spirit — the physics, the patience, the satisfaction — but looked and felt like mine. So I built everything from scratch: a merge chronology panel on the right, restart and clear buttons, a clean top bar with the score, and a little “built-by-Zee” credit at the bottom that made me grin every time it appeared.

Every fruit had its own carefully chosen size, bounce, and colour — because yes, those are hand-drawn fruits, not imported sprites. 

Article content
I wanted them to have my touch, not someone else’s texture. I spent an embarrassing amount of time adjusting them until they felt just right. I refused to change the sizes later — I even told myself, “Don’t you dare touch these; they finally feel balanced.”

That’s when I realised I wasn’t just learning to code a game; I was learning to design one.

The Messy Middle
It wasn’t perfect, obviously. The viewport on mobile refused to cooperate. Some fruits overlapped without merging. The game-over line acted like it had mood swings.

Article content
 I spent hours muttering at my screen, trying to understand why something that worked yesterday suddenly didn’t.

But every bug fixed felt like a small confession from the game itself. Every success... a bounce, a merge, a clean roll — brought back that same quiet joy I’d felt watching my dad tap strawberries.

And I finally realised how much I’d underestimated the technical depth of even a simple game. There’s an entire physics world hidden behind one falling fruit: restitution, velocity thresholds, angular friction, and collision distance. It’s maths, art, and timing all tangled together.

Article content
No wonder Code Bullet laughs manically when his code finally works.

The Quiet After
It started as a “Can I make a game in four hours?” question. But somewhere along the way, it became something else... a reminder that I still love the process of building things that move.

I didn’t make Suika Lite for anyone else. I made it because I missed that feeling, the click of code turning into motion, the first moment when the screen stops being still.

I eventually closed the tab, but my mind didn’t really stop running. There’s something addictive about seeing an idea survive your own doubt. I guess I’m still learning what that kind of curiosity does to a person.

The Skills That Pay Quietly

October 19, 2025
Yesterday, I was telling my childhood friend that I’ve been writing financial articles this month. She nodded, smiled, and asked, “Oh, so you know about the stock market?”

And I… froze. The silence that followed could’ve been traded on the NSE.

That one question humbled me. I realized I’d been spending weeks writing about budgeting and money management and yet, the moment someone mentioned stocks, my brain threw up the blue screen of confusion.

The Financial Curriculum That Doesn’t Exist
College teaches us a lot, but not this. We’re learning how to code, design systems, run data queries, but no one explains how a CTC works or how to stop being scammed by “0% interest” credit card offers.

We’ve got entire semesters on operating systems, but not one lecture on how to operate our own finances.

It’s funny until it’s not. Because we’re all working hard to earn money someday, but barely anyone’s training us to handle it once it arrives.

The Quiet Skills That Actually Matter
There are skills that pay loudly. the ones that fill your résumé and get you applause. Coding, design, trading, content creation.

And then there are the quiet ones. The ones that don’t trend on LinkedIn but hold your life together:

Managing your money
Communicating clearly
Learning how to learn
Following through even when no one’s watching

Honestly, writing this newsletter taught me more about discipline than any course ever did. There’s no grade for consistency, no certificate for showing up... but over time, it compounds, just like good investments.

The Stock Market Moment, Revisited
When my friend asked that question, I laughed and said, “Okay fine, I don’t know the stock market… yet.”

Because maybe that’s the next quiet skill too — financial awareness. Not in the fancy “I’ll be a trader someday” sense, but just understanding where our money sleeps when we’re not looking.

Jobs will come and go. Tech will evolve. But if we can’t manage what we earn, we’ll always feel like we’re one decision away from losing control.

The Bigger Picture
We don’t talk enough about the connection between peace of mind and financial literacy. It’s not about becoming wealthy, it’s about becoming aware. Knowing how to save, when to spend, and when to just breathe and let things unfold.

Maybe the next skill worth learning isn’t on our syllabus or in a certification course. It’s the ability to stay calm in chaos, to handle what we have wisely, and to keep building quietly, steadily, patiently.

Because the skills that pay quietly… stay the longest.

Internship Illusions

October 12, 2025
The Offer Letter Euphoria
In college, “I got an internship!” is our version of fireworks. The group chat lights up with heart emojis, screenshots of offer letters, and the usual flood of “bro proud of you” messages. It feels like we’ve all just collectively made it.

The illusion starts right there — that rush of validation, the feeling that you’ve stepped into adulthood. Until you check the details: no stipend, six-day work week, vague title like Campus Associate Intern (Marketing and Research and Stuff).

Suddenly, adulthood feels suspiciously similar to unpaid labour.

The Unpaid Exposure Economy
Every friend group has one person doing three internships at once, one ghosting their entire life, and one pretending to be “so busy” while secretly watching How I Met Your Mother reruns.

Some of us joined for the brand name, some for the LinkedIn update, some for the certificate we’ll never print. What no one said out loud — at least not at first — was how exhausting it feels to keep showing up for “experience” that doesn’t pay rent, snacks, or even emotional validation.

It’s funny until it’s not. You start to realise the cost of working for free — not just in money, but in time, energy, and self-worth. There’s something heavy about typing out perfect emails while secretly wondering if your time means less because you’re nineteen.

The Reality Behind “Experience”
The logic is simple: if you’re passionate enough, you’ll do it for free. But passion doesn’t pay for cab rides or coffee refills.

And that’s the quiet heartbreak of student life... we’re told to collect experiences like trophies, but nobody tells us that experience sometimes comes with burnout, late-night assignments, and the constant feeling of being replaceable.

Still, we do it. We show up. We learn. We adjust. We find joy in the small things — like getting a shoutout in a meeting, or figuring out how to write a professional email without sounding like ChatGPT.

When Money and Meaning Collide
Somewhere between unpaid internships and pocket-money math, I started building a small habit: tracking how much time I give away. Not just for work, for everything. For people, projects, classes.

That’s how I realised financial literacy isn’t only about knowing how to save; it’s about knowing when you’re giving too much of yourself for too little in return.

It’s not cynicism, it’s awareness. It’s learning that your time has value, even when the world hasn’t learned to price it yet.

A Quiet Lesson
Maybe that’s what this phase is supposed to teach us. Not how to master Excel or Google Sheets, but how to measure worth in more than certificates.

Because yes, internships are illusions sometimes. But inside that illusion, you still pick up things that stick — resilience, boundaries, a sharper sense of when to say “no.”

And maybe that’s the real experience.

Curiosity, Buzzwords, and a Month of Learning Together
August has been one big experiment. I started the month with FOMO. Every scroll through my feed was packed with buzzwords — AI, blockchain, crypto, and I thought, “Wait, am I the only one who doesn’t fully get this stuff?”

So instead of pretending, I decided to write my way through it. Learn as I go, break it down in simple terms, and share the messy parts along the way. There were hiccups, brain-freeze moments, and also those huge lightbulb flashes where I went, “wowww thissss is what it issss.” Looking back, I think that’s the best part, learning with you instead of trying to sound like I already knew it all.

Here’s how the month unfolded.

Week 1: Tech Check Pt. 1
We started with AI, Cloud, Cybersecurity, and Data. These seemed like “big scary grown-up tech words” at first, but as I connected the dots, it became clear they’re simply the invisible framework behind almost everything we use.

The hiccup: realising I was overthinking AI as if it were sci-fi robots, when in fact it’s just systems trained on patterns. The wow moment: when I realised data isn’t just “boring numbers,” but the raw material that every modern system depends on.

Week 2: Tech Check Pt. 2
Next came APIs, UX, Automation, and Web3. This week made me laugh at myself because APIs always felt like some mysterious backend magic. But really, they’re just bridges, a way for apps to talk to each other.

The hiccup: automation seemed dull at first, like a buzzword for lazy shortcuts. The wow moment: realising automation is actually how everything around us operates smoothly, from scheduled emails to large factory systems. Suddenly, it wasn’t dull at all.

And UX? That was the gentle reminder that all this tech only matters if it feels usable.

Week 3: Blockchain and Beyond
This was the week I had the biggest “aha” moment. Blockchain sounded intimidating, like something only finance bros and whitepapers could explain. My hiccup here was mixing it up with crypto entirely. I thought they were the same thing at first.

The wow moment: when I pictured blockchain as a co-op game or a Google Doc where everyone can see edits, but no one can secretly delete history. That analogy just… clicked. From there, voting systems, supply chains, and even healthcare records all started to make sense in a blockchain lens.

Week 4: Crypto and the Future of Digital Currency
Then came the memes and money. Crypto was wild because it wasn’t just about tech; it was also about culture. Dogecoin literally started as a joke, yet people actually made fortunes from it. And during the pandemic, when everything else went online, digital money suddenly didn’t feel so alien.

The hiccup: getting past the chaos of price swings, scams, and overhype. The wow moment: realising crypto isn’t just “magic internet coins,” but part of a bigger conversation about who controls money, how communities build trust, and how the future of payments might look.

Takeaways From August
Looking back, the biggest lesson wasn’t in the definitions, but in the process. Learning tech isn’t about memorising buzzwords, it’s about demystifying them until they feel human.

For me, as a BTech student, these weren’t just weekly articles. They were like mini study sessions about the world I’ll soon be working in. I could see algorithms, security, design, and culture weaving together in real time. It reminded me that being curious is just as important as being skilled.

And here’s a funny bit: some people think I just copy-paste these articles. But the truth is, I sit with them, wrestle with them, edit them until they sound like me. Sometimes I even drop little easter eggs in the text, just to prove I’m really here with you, figuring this out 😂.

Closing Thoughts
This month made me realise tech doesn’t have to feel distant or gatekept. It can be explained, questioned, or even joked about. Curiosity is contagious — and sharing what I learn with you only makes me want to dig deeper.

September is coming, and so is a new theme. I won’t spoil it just yet…

Thanks for sticking with me through August. Here’s to more hiccups, more wow moments, and more buzzwords made simple.

— Notes from a Halfway Point

I thought BTech would be about labs and lectures. Timetables and tests. Turns out, it’s more about trying not to lose your mind somewhere between a buggy project and an unexpected existential crisis at 2 AM.

Now, two years in, I’ve realised: this degree isn’t just about becoming an engineer. It’s about becoming a person. One who knows how to Google better, fail better, and sometimes just... rest better.

This isn’t a highlight reel. It’s a checkpoint. A messy, halfway kind of milestone. And I’m sharing it here not because it’s perfect — but because it’s real.

🧭 1. What I Thought BTech Would Be Like vs. Reality
In my first year, I thought I’d be building apps by Semester 2. That I’d “figure things out” fast. Spoiler: I didn’t.

What I expected: clean code, smart answers, maybe even a working app by midterms. What I got: syntax errors, Stack Overflow spirals, and the slow art of learning how to learn. Figuring out what to figure out was half the journey.

📚 2. Learning to Learn (Without Burning Out)
Somewhere around the 3rd semester, I hit my wall. Not dramatically — just slowly. I’d sit in front of screens and feel my brain fog over.

What helped?

Taking breaks without guilt
Letting myself restart
Making side projects that didn’t need to be “portfolio-worthy.” Just real.

Sometimes, I’d take a night off and wander into Stardew Valley(the game) instead of Stack Overflow. Planting virtual crops, mining for ore — it reminded me that growth, even in games, takes time and patience.

🔧 3. The Projects That Taught Me the Most
Sentiment Analysis Internship — My first solo project, where I felt like a real tech person. Training models, deploying on Streamlit, handling bugs with grace (okay, panic... then grace). 

School Website Project — Helped me go from writing scattered HTML to thinking about structure, users, and design that works.

 My Newsletter, still growing, but already the most me thing I’ve built. Where tech, life lessons, and voice finally meet.

💥 4. Mistakes I Made (and Don’t Regret)
Delayed starting DSA
Got stuck in tutorial loops without building anything
Gave up on some days completely

But every mistake showed me something: That you can pause and still restart. That failure is not a full stop; it’s a rewrite. That “I don’t know yet” is a valid place to be.

🛠️ 5. Skills I Didn’t Know I Was Building
Debugging without panicking
Communicating tech things to non-tech people
Keeping projects organised (or at least functional)
Accepting help. Asking questions. Saying “I don’t get it” and not flinching

🌱 6. What’s Ahead: The Second Half
The next two years look like:

Getting serious about DSA — but on my terms
Diving deeper into AI and creative tech
Building my magazine-style website — the one I’ve been dreaming about
Failing forward, again and again — but this time, a little more prepared

I want to focus on consistency over chaos, creativity over comparison, and clarity over clout.

📝 7. What I’d Tell My First-Year Self
You’re not supposed to be a genius. You’re supposed to be a learner. You’ll feel lost, confused, doubtful and still make beautiful things.

Take your time. And don’t forget: Stardew Valley(the game) is a valid coping mechanism.

🙏🏼 A Quiet Thanks (So Far)
Halfway through BTech, I’ve realised some of the most important lessons didn’t come from textbooks — they came from the people who showed up for us when it mattered. Teachers who explained things twice without making you feel small. Who cracked dry jokes during dull lectures... Who reminded us that learning can be human too.

There’s one or two I’ll remember long after their classes end — not because of any one big moment, but because they made the day feel a little less heavy. This isn’t a thank-you speech. But if I had to pause and look around mid-journey… I’d say I’m quietly grateful.

✨ Final Thoughts
I’m not who I was when I started. And I’m not done becoming whoever I’ll be next. But I know this much now: I can build. I can break. I can begin again. And I’m only halfway through.

💬 
Have you hit a halfway point recently — a degree, a project, a phase of life? What’s something you’d tell your past self?

I'd love to hear.
